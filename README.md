Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to develop a Intrusion Detection System capable of identifying anomalies and malicious activities within a network.

The task is divided into two parts:

A) Binary Classification: Determine whether a network activity is normal or an attack.

B) Multi-class Classification: Identify the specific type of activity, such as Normal, Back etc.

Tech Stack: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM
